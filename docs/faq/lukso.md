# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is LUKSO?

[LUKSO](https://lukso.network/) is a Blockchain network dedicated to existing and coming digital lifestyle use cases. It will be running with a Casper consensus algorithm (PoS) combined with an [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e) (EVM) execution engine. The main network is planned to launch in 2022.

## How to stay up to date about LUKSO?

You can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukso_io), read our [Medium articles](https://medium.com/lukso) and follow the announcements on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso) server.

## Where can I download the Whitepaper?

Here you can find the download link for the [LUKSO Whitepaper](https://lukso.network/assets/LUKSO_Whitepaper.pdf), and the [Technical Lightpaper](https://lukso.network/assets/LUKSO_Technical_Lightpaper.pdf).

## What is LYXe and LYX?

LYX is the native cryptocurrency of the LUKSO Blockchain and is required to secure this decentralized infrastructure. It is used to pay for transaction fees and needs to be locked (staking) to participate in the block production.

"[LYXe](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA8b919680258d369114910511cc87595aec0be6D)" is LYX on the Ethereum Blockchain and is the token that the [Reversible ICO](https://rico.lukso.network) returned.

Once the [LUKSO mainnet](../networks/mainnet.md) starts, there will be a migration of LYXe to LYX on the LUKSO Blockchain. Both LYXe and LYX represent the same asset but on different Blockchain networks.

## I am a developer. Where do I start?

If you are a developer and want to use the future LUKSO Blockchain, you can already start building using our [L14 Public Testnet](../networks/l14-testnet.md) and read our [developer's guides](../guides/universal-profile/create-profile).
